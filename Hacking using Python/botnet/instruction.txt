this sytem was developed from motivation of local chatbot from windows 7 professional version
where you can chat with any pc within lan and can communicate with server also.
But it had some issues with it like,
1. any pc can talk to any pc without permission
2. server can't examine the chats

here we have removed both vulnerabilities like first ip address is must to chat and all messages will be monitored.
